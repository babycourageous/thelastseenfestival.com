The Tipsy Zone is a fully improvised, never before seen episode of the cult classic TV show The Twilight Zone inspired by a single audience suggestion. Watch as skilled improvisers bring to life the surreal and science fiction but with a twist: our performers get more and more tipsy as the show goes on. Come join us as we delve deeper into...The Tipsy Zone.

"[The Tipsy Zone] makes for better improv, better drinking, and a weirder visit to the dimension between the pit of manâ€™s fears and the summit of his knowledge."
