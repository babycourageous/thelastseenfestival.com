*Atlanta, I Love You* is an unconventional love letter to the city - based on the smash hit *Toronto, I Love You* from the Toronto Fringe Festival. It is an unscripted comedy about unexpected connections, set against a backdrop of neighborhoods suggested by the audience.

*Atlanta, I Love You* will feature a handful of spontaneously-crafted storylines that intertwine and intersect each other in surprising ways. Ben Holst and Mike Schatz serve as musical muses for the piece, both underscoring and inciting the action with a mix of Atlanta songs - some improvised, some well-known - chosen to complement the stories.  “It’s a little like P.T. Anderson’s Magnolia, only much less... depressing,” says director Julie Dumais Osborne (Toronto). “We’re playing with light magic realism.”
