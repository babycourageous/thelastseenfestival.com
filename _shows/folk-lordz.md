Braiding together high-octane improv comedy with folk storytelling, Rapid Fire Theatre’s Todd Houseman and Ben Gorodetsky present *Folk Lordz*!

__The Recipe:__

1. Take one part Cree myth from the Indigenous oral tradition.
2. Add one part Russian character drama inspired by the writing of Anton Chekhov.
3. Stir in one part brand new genre – chosen by the audience at each show!
4. Bake for 60 minutes to create a fast, physical, and folksy improv show like you’ve never seen before!

*Folk Lordz* have been featured at the Vancouver International Improv Festival, Philladelphia’s DuoFest, Toronto’s Combustion Festival, Winnipeg’s Gas Station Arts Centre,  Edmonton’s Thousand Faces Festival of Mythic Art, LitFest, Toronto, Winnipeg and Edmonton Fringe Festivals.
They are the recipients of two Cultural Diversity in the Arts awards from the Edmonton Arts Council.
