Braiding together high-octane improv comedy with folk storytelling, Rapid Fire Theatre’s Todd Houseman and Ben Gorodetsky present Folk Lordz!

__The Recipe:__

1. Take one part Cree-Blackfoot war story from the Indigenous, oral history.
2. Add one part Jewish fool’s tale inspired by Yiddish literature.
3. Stir in one part brand new genre – chosen by the audience at each show!
4. Bake for 60 minutes in a sweaty Fringe venue to create a fast, furious, and folksy improv show like you’ve never seen before!

Folk Lordz have been featured at the Vancouver International Improv Festival, Philladelphia’s DuoFest, Winnipeg’s Gas Station Arts Centre, Toronto’s Combustion Festival, Edmonton’s Thousand Faces Festival of Mythic Art, LitFest, Toronto, Winnipeg and Edmonton Fringe Festivals, and headlined numerous CHiMPROV shows at Rapid Fire Theatre.
