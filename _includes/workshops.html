      <p>As improvisers, we can take our scene work to fantastical places, but striking the balance between the absurd and the grounded is important for interesting and dynamic improvisation. This workshop strives to explore truthful character work that can exist within any scene, giving it heart and integrity. No matter what sort of scenario you find yourself in, this workshop will provide you with the tools to have your characters respond from an honest and emotional place. Once you begin to apply these nuances to your work, you’ll find your audience is much more connected to what you’re sharing with them. Plus it totally makes it more funny, which never hurts.</p>
