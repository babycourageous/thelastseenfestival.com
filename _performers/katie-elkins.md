Katie Elkins is a professional food service technician by night and an improviser by late night. She started studying improv two years ago at Highwire Comedy Co, and feels #blessed to be a part of the Tipsy Zone, which is a combination of all things lovely: friends, imaginary circumstances, and alcohol. In her spare time, you can catch Katie writing down all her feelings in her diary, checking her horoscope (cancer/leo cusp, thanks for asking), and performing monthly at Dottie and Rap Battlez.
