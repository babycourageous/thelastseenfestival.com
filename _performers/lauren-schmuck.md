Lauren Schmuck is so excited to join the amazing cast of The Tipsy Zone. The Tipsy Zone has got it all: acting, drinking, fancy clothes, mystery, intrigue, laughter! She has been doing improv for 2 years. She went through the class program at The Village Theatre where she is now a regular performer with the house team, Danger. Lauren has so enjoyed learning, growing, and meeting all the amazing people in the Atlanta improv community. Lauren's other interests include: cats, the deer Snapchat filter, Honey Bubble, witchcraft, and cats. You can see her performing with her other projects including Pretty Much Sisters, Ladylike A Variety Show, RoadTrip, Old Lady Times, and a new group that hasn't found a name yet but is super fun.
