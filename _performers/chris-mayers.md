Raised by wolves in the Mongolian wilderness and now technically an actor or whatever, Chris Mayers stumbled into improv like a drunken elephant, except without all the alcohol. Or tusks. Okay, mostly he just loves peanuts. He has studied acting and improv at The Atlantic Theater in New York, Second City in Chicago, SCAD in Savannah, and Dadâ€™s Garage and Highwire in Atlanta. Past stage productions include The Sleepy Hollow Experience; Shakespeare, Unscripted; The Last Days of Judas Iscariot; and Almost, Maine. He was a national finalist at the College Improv Festival in Chicago and now regularly contributes as a writer and performer for sketch and improv at Highwire Comedy Co.
