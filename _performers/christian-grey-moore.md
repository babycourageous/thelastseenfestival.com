Christian created The Tipsy Zone to put together two of his passions: Science Fiction and drinking. Christian, age 25, has been doing improv for almost 10 years now having started in highschool in North Carolina, then traveling to Chicago to study at the amazing iO, and finally ended up at his new home at Highwire theater here in Atlanta. He's currently obsessed with the show Westworld so if you're looking to swap fan theories, he's your guy. Christian can be seen performing with his other projects including Howard 5000, Outta Towne Sketch, and Two Detectives.
