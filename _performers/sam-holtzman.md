Sam is ecstatic to be working with The Tipsy Zone. He plays piano (wow!) and loves both to gasp at strange dogs on the side of the road and also compliment their ears or tails. He has had no formal training in the art of piano improvisation, but has played around the Atlanta area with various improv troupes. The Tipsy Zone, however, is by far the most fun, and drunk, troupe he's ever played for. In his free time, he is studying to become a molecular pharmacologist and Batman.
