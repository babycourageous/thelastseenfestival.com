Bret Brammer has a lot of passions: carpentry, improv, the hit ABC drama Lost. Having been performing for over 8 years, he's excited to be playing this weekend with The Tipsy Zone, but you can also find him performing Shakespeare Unscripted, #Ghostcode, and the upcoming Holiday Sketch show, all at Highwire. If you're free, visit him in the booth during the festival. He's a real hoot and a half hoot.
