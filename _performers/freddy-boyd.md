Freddy Boyd is a bad mamma jamma, just as fine as he can be. He likes shirts with animals on them and slays karaoke stages. He is a seemingly lifelong engineering student and has lived in Georgia (by way of Lawrenceville) all of his life. In 2012 he took his talents to Atlanta and learned how to improv himself, first with Georgia Tech's own LTT! and then studying at Highwire Comedy Co. For 4ish years, Freddy has been on the quest for the funny and has been honored to find it performing with great groups such as The Tipsy Zone, Howard 5000, The Cardigan Party, H.O.T.M.O.M.S., and the Dad's Garage Rookies. Get at him.
