Evany Rosen is a Toronto native and founding member of acclaimed sketch troupe *Picnicface*, who's titular television series on the Comedy Network has gained awards for everything from Best Writing to Best Ensemble. An accomplished improviser and standup, Evany has toured festivals across Canada, including Just for Laughs, the Winnipeg Comedy Festival, and Edmonton's Improvaganza. When not on stage, she can be seen starring in award winning web series *Space Janitors* or playing truly awkward bit parts in Canadian series like HBO's *Call Me Fitz* and CTV's *Saving Hope*. She can be heard regularly on CBC's *The Debaters*, and as cartoon characters in upcoming series like Teletoon's *The Ridonculous Race* and *Winston Steinburger & Dudley Ding Dong*. Evany's writing credits also include *This Hour Has 22 Minutes*, *Meet the Family*, *Unusually Thicke*, and most recently *Gaming Show in My Parents' Garage* on Disney XD. A Bad Dog regular, Evany can often be found lurking around the theatre performing, directing, and teaching as a member of the Bad Dog Academy Faculty. She is also an avid and highly unsolicited enthusiast of 90s fish-out-of-water sitcom, *The Nanny* (now on Canadian Netflix!).
