Dan Triandiflou is here for you. Plain and simple. He was an ensemble at the previous three Last Seen Comedy Festivals and frankly, it's been down hill ever since. He hasn't aged well and still has trouble communicating his ideas without screaming and/or crying. Nevertheless, Rene Dellefont has not learned his lesson. Dan plays Benji on the Adult Swim series *You're Pretty Face is Going to Hell* (Season Three just started so get to it)! He acts all over the place. Really, at this point, is just kind of sad.
