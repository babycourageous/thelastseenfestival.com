  The Last Seen Festival is a showcase of provocative and original comedy featuring comedians and improvisers from Atlanta attempting to capture the sense of eccentricity, unconventional style, and irreverent behavior that the enigmatic Doug Dank left with us.

  The 2016 Last Seen Festival will be held __November 17-20__ at __Highwire Studios__ in Atlanta, GA. The festival will feature talent from Atlanta, Toronto, and Edmonton.
