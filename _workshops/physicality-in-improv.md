This workshop will heighten your physical presence on stage, expand your character range, and sensitize your group-mind for big, beautiful physical choices. Drawing on elements of clown, physical theatre and acrobatics this approach will arm you with techniques to develop your comedy beyond words and wit. You're not just a brain in a jar, so use that beautiful bod of yours, darn tootin!
